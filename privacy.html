  <h1>Privacy Policy – ConciseAI</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 19, 2025</p>

  <p>ConciseAI is a Chrome extension that provides AI-powered summarization of web page content. Your privacy is important to us. This policy outlines what data we access and how we handle it.</p>

  <h2>What We Access</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We access the content of the web page you're currently viewing, only to summarize it.</li>
    <li>If you enter an API key for Gemini AI, it is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's extension storage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>

    <li>We do not collect, log, or transmit any personal data.</li>
    <li>We do not sell or share your data with third parties.</li>
    <li>We do not track your browsing activity or history.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We send the article content to the <strong>Gemini API</strong> to receive AI-generated summaries. This is the only external request made, and it's done securely.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Your Gemini API key is stored locally and never transmitted to any server other than Gemini.</p>
